Hi team 👋

Thanks for sharing the InnoPaaS API connection guides. I've reviewed the documentation and here's my plan:

**Current Status:**
✅ App releases are done (Play Store & App Store Connect)
✅ InnoPaaS integration code is already implemented in the backend
✅ Production config is set up with InnoPaaS credentials

**What I'm working on now:**
1. **Minor admin dashboard tweaks** - Almost done, just finalizing a few UI improvements
2. **InnoPaaS integration verification** - Testing the API connection and ensuring OTP codes are sent correctly
3. **Configuration updates** - Verifying all environments (dev/staging/prod) are properly configured

**Next Steps:**
- Test InnoPaaS API connection with the provided credentials
- Verify OTP delivery for Rwanda operators (especially +250 numbers)
- Complete admin dashboard refinements
- Deploy and test end-to-end

I'll keep you updated on progress. Should have this wrapped up soon! 🚀
